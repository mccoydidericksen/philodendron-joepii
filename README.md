## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:
- **users** - User accounts synced with Clerk
- **plants** - Plant profiles with detailed attributes and care requirements
- **care_tasks** - Recurring and one-time care tasks with recurrence patterns
- **task_completions** - Historical record of completed tasks
- **plant_media** - Photos and videos stored in Vercel Blob
- **plant_notes** - Markdown notes for plants
- **plant_links** - External resource links (TikTok, YouTube, articles)
- **notifications** - In-app notifications for tasks
- **user_notification_preferences** - Per-user notification settings (SMS/email)
- **plant_groups** - Shared plant collections (Clerk Organizations)
- **plant_group_members** - Group membership and roles

See `lib/db/schema.ts` for complete schema details.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for required environment variables.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed on Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

## Key Features Explained

### Kanban Task Board
The dashboard features a drag-and-drop Kanban board that can be toggled between two views:
- **By Status**: Tasks organized by upcoming, due today, and overdue
- **By Type**: Tasks organized by care type (water, fertilize, mist, etc.)

### Plant Groups (Clerk Organizations)
Plant groups allow multiple users to collaborate on plant care:
- Create groups for households, roommates, or shared spaces
- Assign plants to specific group members
- Assign tasks to specific members
- Track who's responsible for what

### Smart Recurrence
Care tasks automatically recalculate their next due date when completed:
- Daily, weekly, monthly patterns supported
- Specific days of the week for weekly tasks
- Last care dates tracked on plant records

### Demo Mode
New users can explore the app with pre-populated demo data to see all features in action before creating their own plants.
